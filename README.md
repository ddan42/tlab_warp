- Training reward model (change the download folder): https://www.kaggle.com/code/dd4242/reward-training
- One WARP model training (download the dataset in CsV, change pathes to dataset and RM): https://www.kaggle.com/code/dd4242/warp-training
- warp_hyperparams same training process with changing hyperparameters: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dd4242/warp-hyperparams
- evaluation of models with different hyperameters (change path to the models): https://www.kaggle.com/code/dd4242/warp-eval and https://www.kaggle.com/code/dd4242/warp-hyperparams-eval
